How to run the code with Moriond 2013

1) ensure that CMSSW is setup. 538 has been explicity tested but others may work
2) ensure you are in the Nspectra directory (ie the directory this file is in)
3) download http://sharper.web.cern.ch/sharper/cms/ZPrimeMoriond2013Workspaces.tgz to this directory
4) tar -zcvf ZPrimeMoriond2013Workspaces.tgz
5) gmake -f GNUmakefileLimitMoriond2013
6) ./LimitMoriond2013 1 1 1 1000 2 100000 testLim_allchannels_Moriond13 observed workspaces/ 0 1 1.5 1
arguements are:
[1] type: int (0 -> false; 1,2,.. -> true), meaning: use dimuon channel?
[2] type: int (0 -> false; 1,2,.. -> true), meaning: use dielectron EBEB channel
[3] type: int (0 -> false; 1,2,.. -> true), meaning: use dielectron EBEE channel 
[4] type: double, meaning: signal mass hypothesis
[5] type: int, meaning: iterations/toy experiments
[6] type: int, meaning: length of the Markov Chain
[7] type: string, meaning: file name suffix for the output
[8] type: string, meaning: mode of running: available options are 'observed' or 'expected'
[9] type: string, meaning: path to the directory with the single channel workspaces
[10] type: int (0 -> false; 1,2,.. -> true), meaning: write posterior plots?
[11] type: int (0 -> false; 1,2,.. -> true), meaning: restrict mass range for the unbinned likelihood?
[12] type: double, meaning: factor on estimated POI range (for convergence tests)
[13] type: int (0 -> false; 1,2,.. -> true), meaning: apply systematic uncertainty on resonance mass hypothesis?

The above command will run full channel combination for observed limits twice with 100000 length Markov Chain for a signal mass of 1000 GeV. It will take some time...
